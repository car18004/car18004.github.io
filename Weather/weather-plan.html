        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of <strong><i>The Weather Site</i></strong> is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways. The initial page will give the <br> 
            weather for the current location based on the Geocoding location information from the device. The second is weather for 3<br>
            specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location determined by a search string.</p>
        
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>Primary audience is adults ages 18-30. Most will be students. Access to the site will be split between mobile devices and<br>
           laptops. A secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather.</p>
        
        <h2>Audience Goals:</h2>
        <p>College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions for their current location <br> 
            as they head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the conditions for <br>
            a specific location is important as well. The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to get weather conditions<br> 
            for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips.</p>
       
        <h3>Persona</h3>
        <img src="/weather/images/cool-joe.jpg">
        <ul><strong>Name</strong>: Joe Cool</strong></ul>

        <ul><strong>Occupation</strong>: student</ul>

        <ul><strong>Age</strong>: Eternally 18</ul> 

        <ul><strong>Interests</strong>: Traveling, Flying, Play acting, Eating</ul>

        <ul><strong>Motivation</strong>: Joe is not into planning. His last minute scrambling, whether it is getting to class in the morning or<br>
                                         heading out on his latest adventure, has left him unprepared for weather conditions many times (He is tired of sleeping<br>
                                         in the rain and snow). He would like to be more prepared...without having to put much effort into it...or planning.</ul>

        <ul><strong>Environment</strong>: Joe is comfortable using laptops and Mobile devices, he will most often be found on a smartphone<br>
                                          however. Many of the places he frequents do not have great signalâ€¦he is often dealing with 3G speeds</ul>
        
        <h3>Content</h3>

        <p>All weather pages should include location name, current temperature, forecast high, forecast low, current weather descriptor,<br> 
           forecast percentage of precipitation, and current wind speed and direction on small devices and hourly temps should be added <br>
           on larger screens. The pages of <strong><i>The Weather Site</i></strong> will be built in the following order:</p>

        <h4>Pages</h4>

        <ul>1.  Franklin and Greenville weather for each specific location. The weather for these pages should be pulled from the<br>
                weather.JSON file that will be provided.</ul>

        <ul>2.  Current: weather for the current location. Current location should be determined by using the Geolocation API of the<br>
                browser. This information should be passed to the National Weather Service (NWS) API to retrieve the current conditions.</ul>

        <ul>3.  Search: Begins with only a search box, characters entered will cause a list of suggested matches to appear. Selected<br>
                location will pull up the weather.</ul>
